# ALDuino
NAOqi interface for the arduino microcontroller.

Currently works with the Arduino Uno programmed with the StandardFirmata (included with the official Arduino software).

The repository had a gitsubmodule at ALDuino/lib/butane. This is not publicly accesible unfortunately. However, the includded package can be installed on a robot since it contains a static copy of the butane code.

Current fucntionality is limited to setting the digital pins and reading the analog ones on an Arduino Uno Board.
